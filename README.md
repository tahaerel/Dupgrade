Our goal in this game is to develop our village to mine more minerals (Gold, Steel, Diamond etc.), to strengthen our character's equipment with the minerals we extract, so that we can hunt creatures in dangerous dungeons and get rewards such as NFTs and tokens. <br>

Examples of these NFTs;
<br>
-Rare and Powerful Mineral Resources.<br>
-Rare Equipment (Armor, Sword, Bow, etc.).

<br>
<h2>Timeline<h2> <br>
-The more mine collectors and storage areas players buy, the more ore they can passively mine.<br>
-With the mines they mine, they produce new equipment from the village building. <br>
-Customize your character with more powerful equipment.<br>
-Enter dangerous dungeons.<br>
-Defeat the boss at the end of the dungeon and access the mystery box.<br>
-The NFT from the mystery box can be used or sold in the marketplace.<br>
-Players can improve their villages faster by buying Dupgrade tokens.<br>
